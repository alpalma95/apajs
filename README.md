# RoundJS

<small>... Because it's a minimal and bad substitute for Angular.</small>

## Intro

Two-classes abstraction over native Web Components API.

This is basically Vanilla JS. It only provides:

- Reactive state with the `this.defineState()` method
- Attributes passed as "props" (`:attr` syntax) can be automatically accessed via `this.whatever`
- Observable-like object to share state between components (`Streams`)
- Templating syntax based on tagged template strings. This allows us to do things more similarly to JSX and even attach event listeners inline (`@click` etc.)

For the rest, just use JavaScript. ~~Even attaching event listeners must be done with `EventTarget.addEventListener()`~~.

> Actually, with the latest commit I implemented a "smarter" templating system (quote unquote, still have to make it smart enough) and we can now add event listeners like in modern libraries with `@event` directive ðŸ™Œ

A quick look to the code must be enough to notice this, but just in case: **NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION, PROBABLY WON'T BE AND WHY WOULD YOU NEED YET ANOTHER LIBRARY**.

This is just a side project made for fun, for my own edification. I intend to build examples and find more common pain points I'd like to address, so the API will change.

_Nonetheless_, I'm always open to feedback. As soon as I have the docs ready and I feel that I've maxed out my own improvement capabilities, I'll even accept PRs if anyone is interested in contributing. Let's learn together ðŸ™‚.

## Upcoming

Things I'm planning to address in the following weeks:

- [ ] Write docs with the current status
- [ ] Add type annotations and comments for better DX
- [ ] Build stuff and take notes about things I'd like to address
- [ ] Write tests
- [x] Add "template engine" with the help of [htm](https://github.com/developit/htm)
  - Note: It is pretty basic and sometimes buggy. I'm working on it to make it more solid.
- [x] Brag about it 'cause hell I'm proud (just invested a couple of [working] days so... well...)

Thanks for reading ðŸ™‚
